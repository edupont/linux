                        Netlink interface for ethtool
                        =============================


Basic information
-----------------

Netlink interface for ethtool uses generic netlink family "ethtool" (userspace
application should use macros ETHTOOL_GENL_NAME and ETHTOOL_GENL_VERSION
defined in <linux/ethtool_netlink.h> uapi header). This family does not use
a specific header, all information in requests and replies is passed using
netlink attributes.

In requests, device can be identified by ifindex or by name; if both are used,
they must match. In replies, kernel fills both. The meaning of flags,
info_mask and index fields depends on request type.

The ethtool netlink interface uses extended ACK for error and warning
reporting, userspace application developers are encouraged to make these
messages available to user in a suitable way.

Requests can be divided into three categories: "get" (retrieving information),
"set" (setting parameters) and "action" (invoking an action).

All "set" and "action" type requests require admin privileges (CAP_NET_ADMIN
in the namespace). Most "get" type request are allowed for anyone but there
are exceptions (where the response contains sensitive information). In some
cases, the request as such is allowed for anyone but unprivileged users have
attributes with sensitive information (e.g. wake-on-lan password) omitted.


Conventions
-----------

Attributes which represent a boolean value usually use u8 type so that we can
distinguish three states: "on", "off" and "not present" (meaning the
information is not available in "get" requests or value is not to be changed
in "set" requests). For these attributes, the "true" value should be passed as
number 1 but any non-zero value should be understood as "true" by recipient.

Some request types allow passing an attribute named ETHA_*_INFOMASK with
a bitmask telling kernel that we are only interested in some parts of the
information. If info mask is omitted, all available information is returned.
Meaning of info mask bits depends on request type and is listed below.


Device identification
---------------------

When appropriate, network device is identified by a nested attribute named
ETHA_*_DEV. This attribute can contain

    ETHA_DEV_INDEX	(u32)		device ifindex
    ETHA_DEV_NAME	(string)	device name

In device related requests, one of these is sufficient; if both are used, they
must match (i.e. identify the same device). In device related replies both are
provided by kernel. In dump requests, device is not specified and kernel
replies with one message per network device (only those for which the request
is supported).


Bit sets
--------

For short bitmaps of (reasonably) fixed length, standard NLA_BITFIELD32 type
is used. For arbitrary length bitmaps, ethtool netlink uses a nested attribute
with contents of one of two forms: compact (two binary bitmaps representing
bit values and mask of affected bits) and bit-by-bit (list of bits identified
by either index or name).

Compact form: nested (bitset) atrribute contents:

    ETHA_BITSET_LIST	(flag)		no mask, only a list
    ETHA_BITSET_SIZE	(u32)		number of significant bits
    ETHA_BITSET_VALUE	(binary)	bitmap of bit values
    ETHA_BITSET_MASK	(binary)	bitmap of valid bits

Value and mask must have length at least ETHA_BITSET_SIZE bits rounded up to
a multiple of 32 bits. They consist of 32-bit words in host byte order, words
ordered from least significant to most significant (i.e. the same way as
bitmaps are passed with ioctl interface).

For compact form, ETHA_BITSET_SIZE and ETHA_BITSET_VALUE are mandatory.
Similar to BITFIELD32, a compact form bit set requests to set bits in the mask
to 1 (if the bit is set in value) or 0 (if not) and preserve the rest. If
ETHA_BITSET_LIST is present, there is no mask and bitset represents a simple
list of bits.

Kernel bit set length may differ from userspace length if older application is
used on newer kernel or vice versa. If userspace bitmap is longer, an error is
issued only if the request actually tries to set values of some bits not
recognized by kernel.

Bit-by-bit form: nested (bitset) attribute contents:

    ETHA_BITSET_LIST	(flag)		no mask, only a list
    ETHA_BITSET_SIZE	(u32)		number of significant bits (optional)
    ETHA_BITSET_BITS	(nested)	array of bits
	ETHA_BITSET_BIT
	    ETHA_BIT_INDEX	(u32)		bit index (0 for LSB)
            ETHA_BIT_NAME	(string)	bit name
	    ETHA_BIT_VALUE	(flag)		present if bit is set
        ETHA_BITSET_BIT
	...

Bit size is optional for bit-by-bit form. ETHA_BITSET_BITS nest can only
contain ETHA_BITS_BIT attributes but there can be an arbitrary number of them.
A bit may be identified by its index or by its name. When used in requests,
listed bits are set to 0 or 1 according to ETHA_BIT_VALUE, the rest is
preserved. A request fails if index exceeds kernel bit length or if name is
not recognized.

When ETHA_BITSET_LIST flag is present, bitset is interpreted as a simple bit
list. ETHA_BIT_VALUE attributes are not used in such case. Bit list represents
a bitmap with listed bits set and the rest zero.

In requests, application can use either form. Form used by kernel in reply is
determined by a flag in flags field of request header. Semantics of value and
mask depends on the attribute. General idea is that flags control request
processing, info_mask control which parts of the information are returned in
"get" request and index identifies a particular subcommand or an object to
which the request applies.


List of message types
---------------------

    ETHNL_CMD_EVENT			notification only
    ETHNL_CMD_GET_STRSET
    ETHNL_CMD_SET_STRSET		response only

All constants use ETHNL_CMD_ prefix, usually followed by "GET", "SET" or "ACT"
to indicate the type.

Messages of type "get" are used by userspace to request information and
usually do not contain any attributes (that may be added later for dump
filtering). Kernel response is in the form of corresponding "set" message;
the same message can be also used to set (some of) the parameters, except for
messages marked as "response only" in the table above. "Get" messages with
NLM_F_DUMP flags and no device identification dump the information for all
devices supporting the request.

Type ETHNL_CMD_EVENT is special, these messages are never used in userspace
requests or kernel replies. They are only sent by kernel to sockets listening
to "monitor" multicast group to inform userspace about certain events.

Later sections describe the format and semantics of these request messages.


EVENT
-----

EVENT messages are only used in kernel multicast notifications. Atributes
correspond to specific event types, the same type can appear multiple times.

    ETHA_EVENT_NEWDEV		(nested)	new device was registered
       ETHA_NEWDEV_DEV			(nested)	new device
    ETHA_EVENT_DELDEV		(nested)	device was unregistered
       ETHA_DELDEV_DEV			(nested)	removed device
    ETHA_EVENT_RENAMEDEV	(nested)	device was renamed
       ETHA_RENAMEDEV_DEV		(nested)	renamed device

For ETHA_EVENT_RENAMEDEV, the name ETHA_RENAME_DEV/ETHA_DEV_NAME is the new
name after the rename.

Userspace application must expect multiple events to be present in one message
and also multiple events of the same type (e.g. two or more newly registered
devices).


GET_STRSET
----------

Requests contents of a string set as provided by ioctl commands
ETHTOOL_GSSET_INFO and ETHTOOL_GSTRINGS. String sets are not user writeable so
that the corresponding SET_STRSET message is only used in kernel replies.
There are two types of string sets: global (independent of a device, e.g.
device feature names) and device specific (e.g. device private flags).

Request contents:

    ETHA_STRSET_DEV		(nested)	device identification
    ETHA_STRSET_COUNTS		(flag)		request only string counts
    ETHA_STRSET_STRINGSET	(nested)	string set to request
        ETHA_STRINGSET_ID		(u32)		set id

Kernel response contents:

    ETHA_STRSET_DEV		(nested)	device identification
    ETHA_STRSET_STRINGSET	(nested)	string set to request
        ETHA_STRINGSET_ID		(u32)		set id
        ETHA_STRINGSET_COUNT		(u32)		number of strings
        ETHA_STRINGSET_STRINGS		(nested)	array of strings
            ETHA_STRING_INDEX			(u32)		string index
            ETHA_STRING_VALUE			(string)	string value

ETHA_STRSET_DEV, if present, identifies the device to request device specific
string sets for. Depending on its presence a and NLM_F_DUMP flag, there are
three type of GET_STRSET requests:

 - no NLM_F_DUMP, no device: get "global" stringsets
 - no NLM_F_DUMP, with device: get string sets related to the device
 - NLM_F_DUMP, no device: get device related string sets for all devices

If there is no ETHA_STRSET_STRINGSET attribute, all string sets of requested
type are returned, otherwise only those specified in the request. Flag
ETHA_STRSET_COUNTS tells kernel to only return string counts of the sets, not
the actual strings.
