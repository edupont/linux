                        Netlink interface for ethtool
                        =============================


Basic information
-----------------

Netlink interface for ethtool uses generic netlink family "ethtool" (userspace
application should use macros ETHTOOL_GENL_NAME and ETHTOOL_GENL_VERSION
defined in <linux/ethtool_netlink.h> uapi header). This family does not use
a specific header, all information in requests and replies is passed using
netlink attributes.

In requests, device can be identified by ifindex or by name; if both are used,
they must match. In replies, kernel fills both. The meaning of flags,
info_mask and index fields depends on request type.

The ethtool netlink interface uses extended ACK for error and warning
reporting, userspace application developers are encouraged to make these
messages available to user in a suitable way.

Requests can be divided into three categories: "get" (retrieving information),
"set" (setting parameters) and "action" (invoking an action).

All "set" and "action" type requests require admin privileges (CAP_NET_ADMIN
in the namespace). Most "get" type request are allowed for anyone but there
are exceptions (where the response contains sensitive information). In some
cases, the request as such is allowed for anyone but unprivileged users have
attributes with sensitive information (e.g. wake-on-lan password) omitted.


Conventions
-----------

Attributes which represent a boolean value usually use u8 type so that we can
distinguish three states: "on", "off" and "not present" (meaning the
information is not available in "get" requests or value is not to be changed
in "set" requests). For these attributes, the "true" value should be passed as
number 1 but any non-zero value should be understood as "true" by recipient.

Some request types allow passing an attribute named ETHA_*_INFOMASK with
a bitmask telling kernel that we are only interested in some parts of the
information. If info mask is omitted, all available information is returned.
Meaning of info mask bits depends on request type and is listed below.


Device identification
---------------------

When appropriate, network device is identified by a nested attribute named
ETHA_*_DEV. This attribute can contain

    ETHA_DEV_INDEX	(u32)		device ifindex
    ETHA_DEV_NAME	(string)	device name

In device related requests, one of these is sufficient; if both are used, they
must match (i.e. identify the same device). In device related replies both are
provided by kernel. In dump requests, device is not specified and kernel
replies with one message per network device (only those for which the request
is supported).


Bit sets
--------

For short bitmaps of (reasonably) fixed length, standard NLA_BITFIELD32 type
is used. For arbitrary length bitmaps, ethtool netlink uses a nested attribute
with contents of one of two forms: compact (two binary bitmaps representing
bit values and mask of affected bits) and bit-by-bit (list of bits identified
by either index or name).

Compact form: nested (bitset) atrribute contents:

    ETHA_BITSET_LIST	(flag)		no mask, only a list
    ETHA_BITSET_SIZE	(u32)		number of significant bits
    ETHA_BITSET_VALUE	(binary)	bitmap of bit values
    ETHA_BITSET_MASK	(binary)	bitmap of valid bits

Value and mask must have length at least ETHA_BITSET_SIZE bits rounded up to
a multiple of 32 bits. They consist of 32-bit words in host byte order, words
ordered from least significant to most significant (i.e. the same way as
bitmaps are passed with ioctl interface).

For compact form, ETHA_BITSET_SIZE and ETHA_BITSET_VALUE are mandatory.
Similar to BITFIELD32, a compact form bit set requests to set bits in the mask
to 1 (if the bit is set in value) or 0 (if not) and preserve the rest. If
ETHA_BITSET_LIST is present, there is no mask and bitset represents a simple
list of bits.

Kernel bit set length may differ from userspace length if older application is
used on newer kernel or vice versa. If userspace bitmap is longer, an error is
issued only if the request actually tries to set values of some bits not
recognized by kernel.

Bit-by-bit form: nested (bitset) attribute contents:

    ETHA_BITSET_LIST	(flag)		no mask, only a list
    ETHA_BITSET_SIZE	(u32)		number of significant bits (optional)
    ETHA_BITSET_BITS	(nested)	array of bits
	ETHA_BITSET_BIT
	    ETHA_BIT_INDEX	(u32)		bit index (0 for LSB)
            ETHA_BIT_NAME	(string)	bit name
	    ETHA_BIT_VALUE	(flag)		present if bit is set
        ETHA_BITSET_BIT
	...

Bit size is optional for bit-by-bit form. ETHA_BITSET_BITS nest can only
contain ETHA_BITS_BIT attributes but there can be an arbitrary number of them.
A bit may be identified by its index or by its name. When used in requests,
listed bits are set to 0 or 1 according to ETHA_BIT_VALUE, the rest is
preserved. A request fails if index exceeds kernel bit length or if name is
not recognized.

When ETHA_BITSET_LIST flag is present, bitset is interpreted as a simple bit
list. ETHA_BIT_VALUE attributes are not used in such case. Bit list represents
a bitmap with listed bits set and the rest zero.

In requests, application can use either form. Form used by kernel in reply is
determined by a flag in flags field of request header. Semantics of value and
mask depends on the attribute. General idea is that flags control request
processing, info_mask control which parts of the information are returned in
"get" request and index identifies a particular subcommand or an object to
which the request applies.


List of message types
---------------------

    ETHNL_CMD_EVENT			notification only
    ETHNL_CMD_GET_STRSET
    ETHNL_CMD_SET_STRSET		response only
    ETHNL_CMD_GET_INFO
    ETHNL_CMD_SET_INFO			response only
    ETHNL_CMD_GET_SETTINGS
    ETHNL_CMD_SET_SETTINGS
    ETHNL_CMD_GET_PARAMS
    ETHNL_CMD_SET_PARAMS
    ETHNL_CMD_ACT_NWAY_RST

All constants use ETHNL_CMD_ prefix, usually followed by "GET", "SET" or "ACT"
to indicate the type.

Messages of type "get" are used by userspace to request information and
usually do not contain any attributes (that may be added later for dump
filtering). Kernel response is in the form of corresponding "set" message;
the same message can be also used to set (some of) the parameters, except for
messages marked as "response only" in the table above. "Get" messages with
NLM_F_DUMP flags and no device identification dump the information for all
devices supporting the request.

Type ETHNL_CMD_EVENT is special, these messages are never used in userspace
requests or kernel replies. They are only sent by kernel to sockets listening
to "monitor" multicast group to inform userspace about certain events.

Later sections describe the format and semantics of these request messages.


EVENT
-----

EVENT messages are only used in kernel multicast notifications. Atributes
correspond to specific event types, the same type can appear multiple times.

    ETHA_EVENT_NEWDEV		(nested)	new device was registered
       ETHA_NEWDEV_DEV			(nested)	new device
    ETHA_EVENT_DELDEV		(nested)	device was unregistered
       ETHA_DELDEV_DEV			(nested)	removed device
    ETHA_EVENT_RENAMEDEV	(nested)	device was renamed
       ETHA_RENAMEDEV_DEV		(nested)	renamed device

For ETHA_EVENT_RENAMEDEV, the name ETHA_RENAME_DEV/ETHA_DEV_NAME is the new
name after the rename.

Userspace application must expect multiple events to be present in one message
and also multiple events of the same type (e.g. two or more newly registered
devices).


GET_STRSET
----------

Requests contents of a string set as provided by ioctl commands
ETHTOOL_GSSET_INFO and ETHTOOL_GSTRINGS. String sets are not user writeable so
that the corresponding SET_STRSET message is only used in kernel replies.
There are two types of string sets: global (independent of a device, e.g.
device feature names) and device specific (e.g. device private flags).

Request contents:

    ETHA_STRSET_DEV		(nested)	device identification
    ETHA_STRSET_COUNTS		(flag)		request only string counts
    ETHA_STRSET_STRINGSET	(nested)	string set to request
        ETHA_STRINGSET_ID		(u32)		set id

Kernel response contents:

    ETHA_STRSET_DEV		(nested)	device identification
    ETHA_STRSET_STRINGSET	(nested)	string set to request
        ETHA_STRINGSET_ID		(u32)		set id
        ETHA_STRINGSET_COUNT		(u32)		number of strings
        ETHA_STRINGSET_STRINGS		(nested)	array of strings
            ETHA_STRING_INDEX			(u32)		string index
            ETHA_STRING_VALUE			(string)	string value

ETHA_STRSET_DEV, if present, identifies the device to request device specific
string sets for. Depending on its presence a and NLM_F_DUMP flag, there are
three type of GET_STRSET requests:

 - no NLM_F_DUMP, no device: get "global" stringsets
 - no NLM_F_DUMP, with device: get string sets related to the device
 - NLM_F_DUMP, no device: get device related string sets for all devices

If there is no ETHA_STRSET_STRINGSET attribute, all string sets of requested
type are returned, otherwise only those specified in the request. Flag
ETHA_STRSET_COUNTS tells kernel to only return string counts of the sets, not
the actual strings.


GET_INFO
--------

GET_INFO requests information provided by ioctl commands ETHTOOL_GDRVINFO,
ETHTOOL_GPERMADDR and ETHTOOL_GET_TS_INFO to provide basic device information.
Common pattern is that all information is read only so that SET_INFO message
exists but is only used by kernel for replies to GET_INFO requests. There is
also no corresponding notification.

Request contents:

    ETHA_INFO_DEV		(nested)	device identification
    ETHA_INFO_INFOMASK		(u32)		info mask
    ETHA_INFO_COMPACT		(flag)		request compact bitsets

Info mask bits meaning:

    ETH_INFO_IM_DRVINFO			driver info (GDRVINFO)
    ETH_INFO_IM_PERMADDR		permanent HW address (GPERMADDR)
    ETH_INFO_IM_TSINFO			timestamping info (GET_TS_INFO)

Kernel response contents:

    ETHA_INFO_DEV		(nested)	device identification
    ETHA_INFO_DRVINFO		(nested)	driver information
        ETHA_DRVINFO_DRIVER		(string)	driver name
        ETHA_DRVINFO_FWVERSION		(string)	firmware version
        ETHA_DRVINFO_BUSINFO		(string)	device bus address
        ETHA_DRVINFO_EROM_VER		(string)	expansion ROM version
    ETHA_INFO_TSINFO		(nested)	timestamping information
        ETHA_TSINFO_TIMESTAMPING	(bitset)	supported flags
        ETHA_TSINFO_PHC_INDEX		(u32)		associated PHC
        ETHA_TSINFO_TX_TYPES		(bitset)	Tx types
        ETHA_TSINFO_RX_FILTERS		(bitset)	Rx filters

The meaning of DRVINFO attributes follows the corresponding fields of
ETHTOOL_GDRVINFO response. Second part with various counts and sizes is
omitted as these are not really needed (and if they are, they can be easily
found by different means). Driver version is also omitted as it is rather
misleading in most cases.

ETHA_TSINFO_PHC_INDEX can be unsigned as there is no need for special value;
if no PHC is associated, the attribute is not present.

GET_INFO requests allow dumps.


GET_SETTINGS
------------

GET_SETTINGS request retrieves information provided by ETHTOOL_GLINKSETTINGS,
ETHTOOL_GWOL, ETHTOOL_GMSGLVL and ETHTOOL_GLINK ioctl requests. The request
doesn't use any attributes.

Request attributes:

    ETHA_SETTINGS_DEV		(nested)	device identification
    ETHA_SETTINGS_INFOMASK	(u32)		info mask
    ETHA_SETTINGS_COMPACT	(flag)		request compact bitsets

Info mask bits meaning:

    ETH_SETTINGS_IM_LINKINFO		link settings
    ETH_SETTINGS_IM_LINKMODES		link modes and related
    ETH_SETTINGS_IM_LINKSTATE		link state
    ETH_SETTINGS_IM_WOL			struct ethtool_wolinfo
    ETH_SETTINGS_IM_DEBUG		debugging
    ETH_SETTINGS_IM_FEATURES		features
    ETH_SETTINGS_IM_PRIVFLAGS		device private flags

Response contents:

    ETHA_SETTINGS_DEV		(nested)	device identification
    ETHA_SETTINGS_LINK_INFO	(nested)	link settings
        ETHA_LINKINFO_PORT		(u8)		physical port
        ETHA_LINKINFO_PHYADDR		(u8)		MDIO address of phy
        ETHA_LINKINFO_TP_MDIX		(u8)		MDI(-X) status
        ETHA_LINKINFO_TP_MDIX_CTRL	(u8)		MDI(-X) control
        ETHA_LINKINFO_TRANSCEIVER	(u8)		transceiver
    ETHA_SETTINGS_LINK_MODES	(nested)	link modes
        ETHA_LINKMODES_AUTONEG		(u8)		autoneotiation status
        ETHA_LINKMODES_OURS		(bitset)	advertised link modes
        ETHA_LINKMODES_PEER		(bitset)	partner link modes
        ETHA_LINKMODES_SPEED		(u32)		link speed (Mb/s)
        ETHA_LINKMODES_DUPLEX		(u8)		duplex mode
    ETHA_SETTINGS_LINK_STATE	(nested)	link state
        ETHA_LINKSTATE_LINK		(u8)		link on/off/unknown
    ETHA_SETTINGS_WOL		(nested)	wake on LAN settings
        ETHA_WOL_MODES			(bitfield32)	wake on LAN modes
        ETHA_WOL_SOPASS			(binary)	SecureOn(tm) password
    ETHA_SETTINGS_DEBUG		(nested)	debugging
        ETHA_DEBUG_MSG_MASK		(bitfield32)	debug message mask
    ETHA_SETTINGS_FEATURES	(nested)	device features
        ETHA_FEATURES_HW		(bitset)	dev->hw_features
        ETHA_FEATURES_WANTED		(bitset)	dev->wanted_features
        ETHA_FEATURES_ACTIVE		(bitset)	dev->features
        ETHA_FEATURES_NOCHANGE		(bitset)	NETIF_F_NEVER_CHANGE
    ETHA_SETTINGS_PRIV_FLAGS	(bitset)	device private flags

Most of the attributes and their values have the same meaning as matching
members of the corresponding ioctl structures. For ETHA_LINKMODES_OURS,
value represents advertised modes and mask represents supported modes.
ETHA_LINKMODES_PEER in the reply is a bit list.

For ETHA_WOL_MODES, selector reports wake on LAN modes supported by the
device and value enabled modes.

ETHA_DEBUG_MSG_MASK corresponds to message level (which is actually a bitfield)
as reported by ETHTOOL_GMSGLVL. The selector reports all message types
recognized by kernel and value types enabled for the device.

Bitmaps contained in ETHA_SETTINGS_FEATURES have the same meaning as bitmaps
used in ioctl interference but attribute names are different (they are based
on corresponding members of struct net_device). Legacy "flags" are not
provided, if userspace needs them (most likely only ethtool for backward
compatibility), it can calculate their values from related feature bits
itself. ETHA_FEATURES_HW uses mask consisting of all features recognized by
kernel (to provide all names when using verbose bitmap format), remaining
three use mask equal to value (to save space).

ETHA_SETTINGS_PRIV_FLAGS is a bitset with values of device private flags.
These flags are defined by driver, their number and names (as well as meaning)
are device dependent. For compact bitset format, names can be retrieved as
ETH_SS_PRIV_FLAGS string set.

GET_SETTINGS request is allowed for unprivileged user but ETHA_WOL_SOPASS
is only provided by kernel in response to privileged (netns CAP_NET_ADMIN)
requests.

GET_SETTINGS requests allow dumps and messages in the same format as response
to them are broadcasted as notifications on change of these settings using
netlink or ioctl ethtool interface; feature notifications are also sent
whenever netdev_update_features() or netdev_change_features() is called.


SET_SETTINGS
------------

SET_SETTINGS request allows setting some of the data reported by GET_SETTINGS.
Request flags, info_mask and index are ignored. These attributes are allowed
to be passed with SET_SETTINGS request:

    ETHA_SETTINGS_DEV		(nested)	device identification
    ETHA_SETTINGS_LINK_INFO	(nested)	link settings
        ETHA_LINKINFO_PORT		(u8)		physical port
        ETHA_LINKINFO_PHYADDR		(u8)		MDIO address of phy
        ETHA_LINKINFO_TP_MDIX_CTRL	(u8)		MDI(-X) control
    ETHA_SETTINGS_LINK_MODES	(nested)	link modes
        ETHA_LINKMODES_AUTONEG		(u8)		autonegotiation
        ETHA_LINKMODES_OURS		(bitset)	advertised link modes
        ETHA_LINKMODES_SPEED		(u32)		link speed (Mb/s)
        ETHA_LINKMODES_DUPLEX		(u8)		duplex mode
    ETHA_SETTINGS_WOL		(nested)	wake on LAN settings
        ETHA_WOL_MODES			(bitfield32)	wake on LAN modes
        ETHA_WOL_SOPASS			(binary)	SecureOn(tm) password
    ETHA_SETTINGS_DEBUG		(nested)	debugging
        ETHA_DEBUG_MSG_MASK		(bitfield32)	message mask
    ETHA_SETTINGS_FEATURES	(nested)	device features
        ETHA_FEATURES_WANTED		(bitset)	wanted features
        ETHA_FEATURES_WANT_DIFF		(flag)		actual diff
    ETHA_SETTINGS_PRIV_FLAGS	(bitset)	device private flags

ETHA_LINKMODES_OURS bit set allows setting advertised link modes. If
autonegotiation is on (either set now or kept from before), advertised modes
are not changed (no ETHA_LINKMODES_OURS attribute) and at least one of speed
and duplex is specified, kernel adjusts advertised modes to all supported
modes matching speed, duplex or both (whatever is specified). This
autoselection is done on ethtool side with ioctl interface, netlink interface
is supposed to allow requesting changes without knowing what exactly kernel
supports.

ETHA_WOL_MODES bitfield is interpreted in the usual way, i.e. bits set in the
selector are set to 0 or 1 according to value. To allow the semantics of the
ioctl interface where the whole bitmap is set rather than only modified,
selectors may have also bits not supported by device set and an error is only
issued if any of them is also set in the value (i.e. if userspace tries to
enable mode not supported by device). ETHA_SETTINGS_MSGLEVEL bitfield also
allows bits not recognized by kernel in selector as long as the request does
not attempt to enable them.

When changing device features, only ETHA_FEATURES_WANTED is passed. As usual,
mask defines which bits are to be set and value their values. If the request
has ETHA_FEATURES_WANT_DIFF flag set, reply will contain a message in the same
format as response to GET request, except only two bitsets are provided.
ETHA_FEATURES_WANTED shows difference between requested features and actual
result (dev->features after the operation); mask shows bits which differ and
value their values from the original request (new values are negated). Value
shows changes between old dev->features (before the operation) and new (after
the operation); mask shows bits which have been changed and value their new
values.


GET_PARAMS
----------

GET_PARAMS request retrieves information provided by ioctl comands
ETHTOOL_GCOALESCE (coalescing parameters), ETHTOOL_GRINGPARAM (ring sizes),
ETHTOOL_GPAUSEPARAM (pause parameters), ETHTOOL_GCHANNELS (channel counts),
ETHTOOL_GEEE (EEE settings) and ETHTOOL_GFECPARAM (FEC parameters). For each of
these, there is a bit in header info_mask so that only one type of information
can be requested.

Request contents:

    ETHA_PARAMS_DEV		(nested)	device identification
    ETHA_PARAMS_INFOMASK	(u32)		info mask

GET_PARAMS requests allow dumps and messages in the same format as response
to them are broadcasted as notifications on change of these settings using
netlink or ioctl ethtool interface.


SET_PARAMS
----------

SET_PARAMS request modifies the settings retrieved by GET_PARAMS, i.e. it
replaces ETHTOOL_SCOALESCE, ETHTOOL_SRINGPARAM, ETHTOOL_SPAUSEPARAM,
ETHTOOL_SCHANNELS, ETHTOOL_SEEE and ETHTOOL_SFECPARAM ioctl commands. For each
of these, relevant data attributes are contained in a corresponding nest
attribute. Some of the attributes provided by GET_SETPARAMS are read only and
cannot be set by SET_PARAMS request.

ACT_NWAY_RST
------------

Request autonegotiation restart (equivalent of ETHTOOL_NWAY_RST).

Request contents:

    ETHA_NWAYRST_DEV		(nested)	device identification

If successful, a notification in the same format is sent.


ACT_PHYS_ID
-----------

Physical identification of a NIC (usually by blinking a LED. Equivalent of
ETHTOOL_PHYS_ID.

Request contents:

    ETHA_PHYSID_DEV		(nested)	device identification
    ETHA_PHYSID_LENGTH		(u32)		length in seconds

If length is omitted, maximum length is used. Processing is synchronous, there
is no reply until requested time expires (returns zero) or processing is
interrupted by a signal (returns EINTR). Two notifications are sent: one when
identification starts (with length actually used) and one when it stops (with
length of zero).

Processing of this message is exclusive. While identification is running, all
other ACT_PHYS_ID requests for any device fail with EBUSY. The same holds for
requests using ETHTOOL_PHYS_ID ioctl command.


Request translation
-------------------

The following table maps iosctl commands to netlink commands providing their
functionality. Entries with "n/a" in right column are commands which do not
have their netlink replacement yet.
