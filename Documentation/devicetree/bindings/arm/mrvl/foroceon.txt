* Marvell Feroceon Cache

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "marvell,feroceon-kirkwood".
- reg        : Address of the L2 cache control register

Optional properties:
- writethrough : only if present, the cache will be used in write through mode.

Example:
		l2: l2-cache@20128 {
			compatible = "marvell,marvell,feroceon-kirkwood";
			reg = <0x20128 0x4>;
		};

There are at least two variants of the Feroceon, differing in how
write through is enabled or not. If mv78xx0 support is added, it is
expected to have a different compatibility string.
