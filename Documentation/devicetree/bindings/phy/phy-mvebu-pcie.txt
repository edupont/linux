* Marvell MVEBU PCIe PHY

Power control for the PCIe phy found on Marvell MVEBU SoCs.

This document extends the binding described in phy-bindings.txt

Required properties :

 - reg             : Offset and length of the register set for the PCIe device
 - compatible      : Should be "marvell,mvebu-pcie-phy"
 - clocks	   : phandle of clock that supplies the PCIe device
 - clock-names	   : Should be "pcie"

Example:
		pcie-phy@0 {
			compatible = "marvell,mvebu-pcie-phy";
			reg = <0x40000 0x1a08>;
			clocks = <&gate_clk 2>;
			clock-names = "sata";
			#phy-cells = <1>;
			status = "ok";
		};
