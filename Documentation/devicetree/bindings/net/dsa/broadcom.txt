* Broadcom Starfighter 2 integrated switch device

Required properties:

- compatible: should be "brcm,brcm-sf2"
- reg: addresses and length of the register sets for the device, must be 6
  pairs of register addresses and lengths
- interrupts: interrupts for the devices, must be two interrupts

Optional properties:

- reg-names: litteral names for the device base register addresses,
  when present must be: "core", "reg", "intrl2_0", "intrl2_1", "fcb",
  "acb"

- interrupt-names: litternal names for the device interrupt lines,
  when present must be: "switch_0" and "switch_1"

- brcm,num-gphy: specify the maximum number of integrated gigabit PHYs
  in the switch

- brcm,num-rgmii-ports: specify the maximum number of RGMII interfaces
  supported by the switch

- brcm,fcb-pause-override: boolean property, if present indicates that
  the switch supports Failover Control Block pause override capability

- brcm,acb-packets-inflight: boolean property, if present indicates
  that the switch Admission Control Block supports reporting the
  number of packets in-flight in a switch queue

Example:

	switchdev0: switchdev0 {
		compatible = "brcm,brcm-sf2";
		reg = <0x0 0x40000
			0x40000 0x110
			0x40340 0x30
			0x40380 0x30
			0x40400 0x34
			0x40600 0x208>;
		interrupts = <0 0x18 0
				0 0x19 0>;
		brcm,num-gphy = <1>;
		brcm,num-rgmii-ports = <2>;
		brcm,fcb-pause-override;
		brcm,acb-packets-inflight;
	};
